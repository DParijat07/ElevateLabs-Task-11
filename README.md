# 🎯 Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection
**Cyber Security Internship – Task 11**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **controlled phishing attack simulation** conducted in a **safe lab environment** to understand how phishing attacks are crafted, executed, detected, and prevented.  
The objective is to build **social engineering awareness** and strengthen **defensive cybersecurity skills** relevant to SOC and GRC roles.

> ⚠️ Ethical Disclaimer:  
> This simulation was performed strictly for educational purposes using test accounts only. No real users, organizations, or production systems were targeted.



## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Phishing attack lifecycle
- Social engineering techniques
- Email-based attack vectors
- User behavior analysis
- Phishing detection indicators
- Preventive security controls



## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **GoPhish** (Open-source phishing framework)
- Manual phishing email templates
- Local / isolated lab setup
- Test email accounts only



## 🔬 Methodology
1. Studied real-world phishing techniques
2. Created a fake phishing email template
3. Designed a simulated credential-harvesting landing page
4. Sent phishing emails to controlled test accounts
5. Tracked user interactions (open, click, submit)
6. Identified phishing red flags
7. Documented prevention and mitigation strategies



## 📊 Observations
- Urgency-based emails significantly increase click probability
- Generic greetings and spoofed sender names are common indicators
- Human factors remain the weakest link in phishing attacks



## 🚩 Common Phishing Indicators Identified
- Suspicious sender domains
- Urgent or threatening language
- Mismatched or shortened URLs
- Grammar and spelling errors
- Unexpected attachments or links



## 🛡 Prevention & Mitigation Strategies
- Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- User awareness and phishing training
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- URL inspection and sandboxing
- SOC-level email monitoring and alerting
